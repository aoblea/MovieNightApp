# Movie Night App
## Treehouse iOS Project 7

The Movie Night App is an app to help two friends agree on what movie to watch. The two persons will be using the same iPhone with the app installed, simply by handing it back and forth between them.
This app will access The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org). The Movie Database API is not completely open, hence an API key is required.

This project contains the use of:

  * UITableViews
  * Asynchronous API calls 
  * Storyboards and Autolayout
  * Data Modelling
  * Error Handling
  * Operations and Networking
  * Protocols and Delegates
  
### Project Instructions

  1. Create a workflow where both users can select a set of movie criteria such as genre, actors/actress, etc. The app should perform the matches and present the best possible selection to the users. Please include at least two parameters.
  
  2. Test the app for a variety of inputs, including those which may not be ideal user behavior. Be sure your app can handle any issues gracefully.

### Extra Credit

  * Implement more than 2 selection criteria for the users to specify their preferences, and create the associated TableView and TableViewCells to suppport the selection.
